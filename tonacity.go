// Welcome to music theory, where nothing is unanimously agreed upon, there are multiple equivalent ways of saying the same thing, and the distance between two notes is a second.
// Evidence:
//  - What physical frequency is a particular note?
//  - Which C is middle C?
//  - AùÑ´ == G == FùÑ™
//  - B‚ô≠ == A‚ôØ
//  - C‚ô≠ == B
//  - In C Major the distance between C (note I in the scale), and F (note IV in the scale) is "a fourth"

// In this library presentation has been kept completely separate to the data structures. This is because the name of something typically depends entirely on context.

// Singer Make that object SING. Something which can, given a valid starting pitch, produce an indefinite sequence of notes. For example, the G Major key signature will produce,
